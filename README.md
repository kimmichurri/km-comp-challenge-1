#static comp challenge 1

In this project I created a series of info cards displaying different plants. I used a combination of flex and media queries to 
to make this site more responsive than my previous comp challenge. 

#Header

I created two different main containers in the header to control the right and left side. I used li elements to arrange text 
and icons neatly along with flex.

#Cards

I created one large container for cards and and used three different media queries to target different breakpoints to make the
site more responsive. This is where flex was extremely helpful. I also used three other media queries to allow header elements 
to stack when the screen size reached a smaller mobile size.
